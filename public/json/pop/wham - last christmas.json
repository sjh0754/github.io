I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\n\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA man undercover, but you tore me apart\nOoh-hoo\nNow I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special (special)\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)\nBut the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special (special)\n\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)\nA man undercover, but you tore him apart\nMaybe next year, I'll give it to someone\nI'll give it to someone special (special!)\nSo long!\n"

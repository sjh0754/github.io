I'm loving you\n\nTry, baby, try to trust in my love again\nI will be there, I will be there\nLove, our love just shouldn't be thrown away\nI will be there, I will be there\n\nIf we'd go again, all the way from the start\nI would try to change the things that killed our love\nYour pride has built a wall, so strong that I can't get through\nIs there really no chance to start once again?\n\nIf we'd go again, all the way from the start\nI would try to change the things that killed our love\nYes, I've hurt your pride, and I know what you've been through\nYou should give me a chance, this can't be the end\n\nI'm still loving you\nI'm still loving you\nI'm still loving you\nI need your love\nI'm still loving you\n\nStill loving you, baby\n\nStill loving you\nI need your love\nStill loving you\nI need your love, oh\nStill loving you\nI need your love, oh\nI need your love\nI need your love...\n"

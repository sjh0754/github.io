We're builsing a bridge\nI wonder why can't we be faster than light,\nFaster than airplanes,\nMy precious love\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nGames are forever\n \nJust getting up, you go to sleep\nThousands of miles, so far away\nI'm working so hard\nTo make the games,\nTo get down to Seoul\nSee you again!\n \nI need your love, my long-distance girl\nThe ocean is wide. We're building a bridge\nI wonder why can't we be faster than light,\nFaster than airplanes,\nMy precious love\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nGames are forever\n \nAh ah~ ah ah~\nAh ah~ ah ah~\nAh~ ah~ ahah~ ah\n \nI wonder why can't we be faster than light,\nFaster than airplanes,\nMy precious love\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nGames are forever\n \nAh ah~ ah ah~\nAh ah~ ah ah~\nAh~ ah~ ahah~ ah\n \n[Eva's Humming melody of \"Arirang\", A korean traditional song]\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nGames are forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLoves are forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nGames are forever\n \nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nThe sun goes down in America\nWhen the sun comes up in Korea,\nLove lasts forever\n"

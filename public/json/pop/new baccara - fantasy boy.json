And take me to etermity\n\nI know some day I'm gonna meet,\nFantasy boy, I feel your heat,\nWant to squeeze you, tease you, hold you in my arms.\n\n(*)\nTell me why tell me why you're so real when I dream.\nDon't you know I have to face reality- oh-oh-oh\n\n(**)\nFantasy boy, has been my lover, not my toy  \nCause I need you to be real, to be no fantasy\nI want to touch and feel.\nMy fantasy boy come on and step into my life\nIt's so much harder to survive.\nWithout your love for me. And take me to etermity  \n\nMy Fantasy boy...\n"

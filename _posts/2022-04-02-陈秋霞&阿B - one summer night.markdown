```
One summer night the stars were shining bright
One summer dream made with fancy whims
That summer night my whole world tumbled down
I could have died if not for you

Each time I think of you
My heart would cry for you
The joy and love from you
since i was born
Each night I'd pray for you
My heart would beat for you
You've filled the life for me

Set me free like the sparrows up the tree
Give a sign so I would ease my mind
Just say a word and I'll come running wild
Give me a chance to live again

Each night I think of you.
My heart would cry for you
The joy and love from you.
since i was born
Each night I'd pray for you
My heart would beat for you
You've filled the life for me

One summer night the stars were shining bright
One summer dream made with fancy whims
That summer night my whole world tumbled down
I could have died if not for you

Each time I think of you
My heart would cry for you
The joy and love from you.
since I was born
Each night I'd pray for you
My heart would beat for you
You've filled the life for me
